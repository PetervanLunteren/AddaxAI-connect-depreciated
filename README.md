# AddaxAI-connect
Real-time animal detection system based on [AddaxAI](https://addaxdatascience.com/addaxai/).

Detection system that works with any smart camera trap that can put images in a folder over some kind of network. Works in combination with Signal, Earthranger, Twilio, and more. Documentation is lacking since we're still in the development phase. If you're interested, [email me](mailto:peter@addaxdatascience.com).
